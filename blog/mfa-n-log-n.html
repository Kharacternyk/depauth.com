          <em>
            TL;DR: Given N authentication factors, the optimal number of
            authentication options within each factor approaches log2(N) as N
            grows. However, some problems are only solvable with small N — more
            factors is not always better.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us define a simple model of multi-factor authentication that is
          convenient to analyze. We use locks to protect our homes from
          intruders. It is common to have a few locks — the more locks, the
          harder it is for unauthorized people to get inside. It is also common
          to have a few identical keys for each lock — key loss happens too
          often to rely on a single one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The locks correspond to authentication factors and the keys correspond
          to authentication options within each factor. Let us denote the number
          of locks as $x$ and the number of identical keys for each lock as $y$.
          We assume that there is the same number of keys for each lock and that
          each key fits only one lock.
        </p>
        <p>
          We lose our keys sometimes. If we lose all the keys of a lock, we can
          no longer enter our own home — at least not the normal way. Let us
          denote the probability of losing any one key during the next year $p$.
          We assume that each key is independent and losing one does not affect
          the probability of losing another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, keys can be compromised by getting into wrong hands. If
          someone gets hold of a key for each of the locks, they can get inside.
          For simplicity, we assume that the probability of a key being
          compromised is equal to the probability of a key being lost, $p$.
        </p>
        <p>
          We let $a$ denote the probability of being locked out of our own home
          during the next year that we are comfortable with. Normally, $a \ll
          p$. Similarly, $b$ is the acceptable probability of someone
          unauthorized getting access to our home during the next year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constraints of the multi-factor authentication problem can now be
          expressed mathematically. $$ \begin{cases} 1 - (1 - p^y)^x \le a \\ (1
          - (1 - p)^y)^x \le b \end{cases} $$ The subtle difference between the
          left sides of the inequations comes from the fact that you lose access
          to your home if you lose <em>all</em> keys for <em>one</em> lock,
          whereas unauthorized access comes from compromise of any
          <em>one</em> key for <em>each</em> lock.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inequations let us express $y$ from the other variables. $$
          \begin{cases} y \ge \log_p (1-(1-a)^\frac{1}{x}) \\ y \le
          \log_{1-p}{(1-b^\frac{1}{x}}) \end{cases} $$
        </p>
        <p>
          If we let $x \rightarrow \infty$, we get constraints that do not
          depend on $a$ and $b$. $$ \begin{cases} y \ge -\log_p x \\ y \le
          -\log_{1-p}x \end{cases} $$ Since $\log_2{x} =
          -\log_{\frac{1}{2}}{x}$, it is always between $-\log_p x$ and
          $-\log_{1-p} x$.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are the implications? If $p \le \frac12$, we can solve the
          authentication problem for any $0 \lt a \lt 1$ and $0 \lt b \lt 1$ by
          choosing a large enough number of locks $x$ and having $\log_2x$ keys
          for each lock. If $p \gt \frac12$, no amount of keys will help us if
          the number of locks is large enough. There can still be solutions with
          fewer locks, though. For example, if $a = b = p \gt \frac12$, we are
          satisfied only with $x = y = 1$.

            You can play around with the problem on Desmos.

          All the $(x, y)$ points that satisfy the constraints are within the
          green area. The purple line is $y = \log_2x$ and it always enters the
          green area at some point if $p \le \frac12$.
